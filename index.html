                            My name is Sean Zweifel. I'm a Richmond native and have a bachelors of science in forensic science with a concentration in physical evidence and minor in chemistry from Virginia Commonwealth University. My main work experience is in firearms investigations and intelligence although I've always had an interest in computers and design. I'm hoping to take the skills I've built through the University of Richmond bootcamp to have a successful degree in full stack development.

<!--image and paragraph tag. need something containing both of these elements. maybe a div to act as the parent. we could give the div an id of container or image. display in css affects block or inline. we don't want inline. relative would allow us to move the text around but it won't go over the image. fixed would be like a footer. It'd float it above everything and you tell it where it gets stuck so that even when you scroll, it never disappears. Absolute takes it out of the normal flow and floats it above the other siblings in the parent as long as the parent is relative. if the image container is in position relative and paragraph is in position absolute. -->
