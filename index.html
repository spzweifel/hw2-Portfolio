<!--image and paragraph tag. need something containing both of these elements. maybe a div to act as the parent. we could give the div an id of container or image. display in css affects block or inline. we don't want inline. relative would allow us to move the text around but it won't go over the image. fixed would be like a footer. It'd float it above everything and you tell it where it gets stuck so that even when you scroll, it never disappears. Absolute takes it out of the normal flow and floats it above the other siblings in the parent as long as the parent is relative. if the image container is in position relative and paragraph is in position absolute. -->
